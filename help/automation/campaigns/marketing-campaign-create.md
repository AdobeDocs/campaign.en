You can access the Adobe Campaign console screens via an internet browser to view all campaigns and deliveries as well as reports and information on the profiles in your database. This access does not enable record creation. Depending on operator rights, you may view and/or act on the data in the database. For example, you can approve campaign contents and targeting, re-start or stop a delivery, etc.
