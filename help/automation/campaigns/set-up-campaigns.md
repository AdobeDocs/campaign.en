# Get started with marketing campaigns {#gs-marketing-campaigns}

Adobe Campaign lets you define, optimize, execute and analyze communications and marketing campaigns. Adobe Campaign acts like a unified order and execution center for marketing strategies. Manage multiple data sources, define your audience segments, and plan and execute multi-step, cross-channel campaigns through a drag-and-drop visual workflow interface.


<!--In addition, the **Marketing Resource Management (MRM)** module lets you control marketing actions in a collaborative mode by providing complete management and real-time tracking of the tasks, budgets and marketing resources involved. The Marketing Resource Management lets you optimize and regulate the management of internal and external processes, resources and marketing campaigns, as well as third party relations (agencies, printers, etc.). For more on this, refer to [this section](about-marketing-resource-management.md).

## Key steps to design your campaigns {#key-steps-campaign}

Campaigns include actions (deliveries) and processes (importing or extracting files), as well as resources (marketing documents, delivery outlines). They are used in marketing campaigns. Campaigns are part of a program, and programs are included in a campaign plan.

Key steps to create and execute a marketing campaign in Adobe Campaign are listed below:

1. **Set up your plans and programs** schedule, set up the logic to orchestrate your campaigns
    A program is a set of marketing activities defined for a period. Each program contains campaigns linked to a calendar, which provides an overall view. The marketing plan can contain multiple programs. It defines strategic objectives for a period of time, with an allocated budget, measurable goals and associated documents. Learn how to create plans and programs [in this section](marketing-campaign-create.md#create-plan-and-program).

1. **Create your first campaign**
    A campaign centralizes all the elements related to a marketing campaign: deliveries, targeting rules, costs, export files, related documents, etc. Each campaign is attached to a program. Learn how to create a campaign [in this section](marketing-campaign-create.md#create-a-campaign).

1. **Select the audience**
    Audiences can be imported from a list or built in a campaign workflow using queries. Learn how to define the target audience of a campaign [in this section](marketing-campaign-target.md#select-the-target-population).

1. **Create deliveries**
    Orchestrate your cross channel deliveries in your campaigns. Streamline your communications with Adobe Campaign through personalised emails, SMS, push notifications and in-app messages. You can also add direct mail deliveries. Learn how to create, validate, and monitor deliveries in your campaigns [in this section](marketing-campaign-deliveries.md).

1. **Set up the approcal flow**
    Define reviewers and configure the approval flow to monitor and control processes of the campaign: targeting, content, budget, extraction, and proof sending. Learn how to set up approvals [in this section](marketing-campaign-approval.md).

1. **Monitor deliveries**.
    Track your campaigns from the dashboard, check delivery statuses and execution from Campaign UI. [Learn more](marketing-campaign-monitoring.md).

1. **Track budgets, stocks and associated costs**. 
    Use Adobe Campaign to control budget allocation, manage your suppliers, stocks and costs. [Learn more](providers--stocks-and-budgets.md#create-service-providers-and-their-cost-structures).

When these steps have been completed, you can [start the deliveries](marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#start-a-delivery), check the data, processes and information relating to the deliveries and, if necessary, [manage the associated documents](marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#manage-associated-documents). You can also [track and monitor the execution](marketing-campaign-monitoring.md) of your campaigns and deliveries.
