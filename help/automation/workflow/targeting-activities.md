# Targeting activities in workflows{#about-targeting-activities}

These activities let you build one or more targets by defining sets and splitting or combining these sets using intersection, union, or exclusion operations.

* **[Cells](cells.md)**: provides a view of the various subsets in the form of data columns, and facilitates the manipulation of these subsets when there are many of them.
* **[CRM Connector](crm-connector.md)**: lets you configure the synchronization between Adobe Campaign and a CRM. 
* **[Change data source](change-data-source.md)**: lets you change the data source of a workflow **[!UICONTROL Working table]**. This provides more flexibility to manage data across different data sources such as FDA, FFDA and local database.
* **[Change dimension](change-dimension.md)**: lets you change the targeting dimension during the workflow construction cycle.
* **[Deduplication](deduplication.md)**: lets you remove duplicates from inbound activities. 
* **[Delivery outline](delivery-outline.md)** (in campaign workflows only): lets you add a delivery outline. 
* **[Edit schema](edit-schema.md)**: lets you transform, standardize, and if necessary enrich data.
* **[Enrichment](enrichment.md)**: lets you add columns to a working table or workflow.
* **[Exclusion](exclusion.md)**: lets you create a target based on a main target from which one or more other targets are extracted.
* **[Incremental query](incremental-query.md)**: lets you perform a query and plan its execution. 
* **[Intersection](intersection.md)**: lets you extract only the population with the same inbound activity results.
* **[List update](list-update.md)**: records the result of inbound activities in a list. 
* **[Offers by cell](offers-by-cell.md)**: lets you link different offers to each subset of a population.
* **[Offer engine](offer-engine.md)**: lets you call the Interaction offer engine in a workflow.
* **[Query](query.md)**: lets you create and run a query. 
* **[Read list](read-list.md)**: lets you use data contained in a list.
* **[Split](split.md)**: lets you split a target into several subsets.
* **[Subscription Services](subscription-services.md)**: lets manage target subscriptions and unsubscriptions to an information service.
* **[Union](union.md)**: lets you group the result of several activities into a single target.
* **[Update data](update-data.md)**: lets you massively update the data in the database.
