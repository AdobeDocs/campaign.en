Adobe Campaign provides the Federated Data Access (FDA) option in order to process information stored in one or more external databases: you can access external data without changing the structure of Adobe Campaign data.

Multiple activities allow you to interact with data from an external database:

* Query
* Split
* Enrichment
* Data loading

Use of the FDA option depends on your Adobe Campaign license. Configuring this option as well as the best practices and limitations linked to using it are detailed [in this section](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/connect/fda.html){target="_blank"}.
