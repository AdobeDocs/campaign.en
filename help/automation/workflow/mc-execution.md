     <li> <p><strong>Pending delivery</strong>: the event is in a queue, a message template has been associated to it and is currently being processed by the delivery.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p><strong>Sent</strong>: this status is copied from the delivery logs. It means that the delivery has been sent.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p><strong>Ignored by the delivery</strong>: this status is copied from the delivery logs. It means that the delivery has been ignored.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p><strong>Delivery error</strong>: this status is copied from the delivery logs. It means that the delivery has failed.</p> </li> 
     <li> <p><strong>Event not covered</strong>: the event has failed to be associated with a message template. The event will not be reprocessed.</p> </li>
