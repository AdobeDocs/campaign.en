Email deliveries let you send personalized emails to the target population. 

## Create your first email delivery

Create personalized and contextually relevant emails that are consistent with the rest of the customer experience.

In the following sample, you will learn steps to design an email delivery in Adobe Campaign which contains personalized data, links to an external URL, and a link to the mirror page.

1. **Create the delivery**

   To create a new delivery, browse to the **Campaigns** tab, click **Deliveries** and click the **Create** button above the list of existing deliveries.

1. **Select the template**

   Select a delivery template, then name your delivery. This name will only be visible to users of the Adobe Campaign console and not by your recipients, however this heading will be displayed in your list of deliveries. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.

   * Insert a tracked link

      To take delivery recipients to an external address via an image or a text, select it and click the **[!UICONTROL Add a link]** icon in the toolbar.

      Enter the URL for the link in the **URL** field using the following format **https://www.myURL.com**, then confirm.

   * Add a mirror page

      To allow your recipients to view your delivery content in a web browser, add a link to the mirror page of your message.

      Place the cursor where you want to insert this link, and click the last icon in the toolbar, then click **[!UICONTROL Include]** and select **[!UICONTROL link to mirror page]**.

   Once the content is ready, click **Save**: it will now be displayed in your list of deliveries, in the **[!UICONTROL Campaigns > Deliveries]** tab. Your first email delivery is ready. You now need to define the audience, validate the delivery and send it.
