In most cases, profiles are [imported to Campaign through a workflow](../../../v7/platform/using/import-export-workflows.md). However, you can add one or more profiles directly from the interface, by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button. They will then be added to the database.

Enter the information for this profile. The tabs and fields to be completed are described in [Edit a profile](editing-a-profile.md).

Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to validate profile creation. The profile is then added in Adobe Campaign database.
