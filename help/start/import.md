# Import data into Campaign {#ootb-profiles}

Campaign helps you add contacts to the Cloud database. You can load a file, schedule and automate multiple contact updates, collect data on the Web, or enter profiles info directly into the recipient table.

## Import profiles in a workflow

Profile imports are configured in dedicated templates executed through workflows via the **Import** activity. They can be repeated automatically according to a schedule, for example to automate data exchange between several information systems. Learn more in [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/import-export-workflows.html).

You can also run unitary import jobs to feed your database. Learn more in [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/generic-imports-exports/about-generic-imports-exports.html).
