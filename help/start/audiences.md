# Get Started with audiences{#gs-ac-audiences}

Profiles can be grouped in lists or collected by querying the database.

## Create lists

A list is a static set of profiles that can be targeted in delivery actions or updated during import operations or during workflow execution. For example, a population extracted from the database via a query can supply a list.

Learn more about lists and how to create and manage them in [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/profile-management/creating-and-managing-lists.html).

## Query the database

Use the **Query** activity in a woekflow to query your database, segment data and build complex audiences. 

Learn more about Campaign queries in [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/automating-with-workflows/introduction/targeting-data.html).

All targeting activities are listed in [this page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/automating-with-workflows/targeting-activities/about-targeting-activities.html)
