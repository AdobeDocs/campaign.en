# Get Started with reporting{#gs-ac-reports}

Adobe Campaign provides a set of reporting tools:

* **Built-in reports**: Adobe Campaign offers a set of reports on deliveries, campaigns, platform activities, optional functionalities, etc. These reports are available via the various functionalities which they relate to. They can be adapted to suit your specific needs.

* **Descriptive data analysis**: Adobe Campaign provides a visual tool for producing statistics on the data in the database. You can create descriptive analysis reports using a dedicated wizard and adapt their content and layout depending on your needs.

* **Personalized reports**: Adobe Campaign enables you to create reports on the data in the database. Once these have been created, they are made accessible in the appropriate contexts.

Depending on the complexity of the queries, calculations and volumes, the data analyzed in these reports can be collected via a query and pre-aggregated in a list (‘data management’ type workflow) or in a Cube (using Marketing Analytics). It will be displayed in the form of a pivot table or a group list.
