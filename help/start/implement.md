# Campaign v8 implementation guidelines

In this section, you will learn how to adjust Adobe Campaign to the requirements of your company. Use the following guidelines to structure and organize your implementation. 

* Key tasks for basic set up
* Check configuration: connectors, multi-solution settings
* Add users and grant permissions + share client console
* Check channels settings: email, push, sms
* Import profiles
* Create templates
* Select approvers
* Create typology rules
* Design your workflows
* Extend your deployment

## Add users and grant permissions

You can manually add users to Cammaign and associate them with groups, aligned with your role hierarchy. Users will then be able to log in and access the data and permilssions which are appropriate for them.

Learn how to add users to Adobe Campaign in this section.

## Extend your deployment

You can customize many different Campaign areas and capabilities. Most of our customers customize three things:

1. Tables and schemas

    Adobe Campaign comes with common schemas to identify data such as: recipients, delivery logs, subscriptions, and more. Refer to this section to learn more about Campaign built-in datamodel.
    
    You can extend existing schemas or create new schemas from scratch. Learn more in this page.
    
1. Dashboards and lists

    You can easily configure lists, add and remove fields and customize columns. Learn more.

    You can also create new dashboard depending on your needs. Learn more.

1. Reports

    Campaign provides a set of built-in reports on delivery monitoring, URLs and click streams, tracking, deliverability indicators, and more.

    In addition to built-in reports, Adobe Campaign lets you generate reports in various contexts and to meet different needs. Principles of use and implementation modes are detailed in this document.
