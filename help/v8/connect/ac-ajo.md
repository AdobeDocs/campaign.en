# Work with Campaign and Adobe Journey Optimizer

Integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Journey Optimizer allows you orchestrate customer journeys in Adobe Journey Optimizer and send emails, push notifications and/or SMS using Adobe Campaign Transactional Messaging capabilities.

Basic steps are to create a transactional message template in Campaign, and then create the event, action, and design the journey in Adobe Journey Optimizer.
