# Federated Data Access (FDA){#gs-fda}

Use the FDA Connector (Federated Data Access) to connect Campaign to one or more **external databases** and process information stored into them without affecting your Campaign Cloud Database data. You can then access external data without changing the structure of Adobe Campaign data.

Campaign FDA option allows you to extend your data model in a third-party database. It will automatically detect the structure of the targeted tables and use data from the SQL sources.

Specific **permissions** are required on the external database to work with Campaign.

Once the data schema is created, data can be processed in Adobe Campaign workflows.
