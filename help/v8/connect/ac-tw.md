# Work with Campaign and Twitter

Use the **Managing social networks (Social Marketing)** module to interact with your customers via Twitter.

* Send messages - Use Adobe Campaign Social Marketing to post messages on Twitter. You can also send direct messages to all your followers.

* Collect new contacts - Adobe Campaign Social Marketing also makes it easy to acquire new contacts: contact users and ask them if they want to share their profile information. If they accept, Adobe Campaign automatically recovers the data, which enables you to carry out targeting campaigns and, when possible, to implement cross-channel strategies.
