# Work with Campaign and Twitter

**NOT YET AVAILABLE** 

Use the **Managing social networks (Social Marketing)** option to interact with customers and prospects via Twitter.

* Send messages - Use Adobe Campaign Social Marketing to send messages on Twitter. Adobe Campaign lets you post messages directly to your twitter account. You can also send direct messages to all your followers.

* Collect new contacts - Adobe Campaign Social Marketing also makes it easy to acquire new contacts via Facebook: contact users and ask them if they want to share their profile information. If they accept, Adobe Campaign automatically recovers the data, which enables you to carry out targeting campaigns and, when possible, to implement cross-channel strategies.
