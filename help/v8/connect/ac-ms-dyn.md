# Work with Campaign and Microsoft Dynamics 365{#crm-ms-dynamics}

Activate your CRM data on cross-channel communication: learn how to pass on contacts from **Microsoft Dynamics 365** to Adobe Campaign, and share campaign performance data (sends, opens, clicks, and bounces) back from Adobe Campaign to Microsoft Dynamics 365.

Once configuration is done, data synchronization between systems is carried out via a dedicated workflow activity. [Learn more](crm-data-sync.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Supported Microsoft Dynamics versions are detailed in Campaign [Compatibility matrix](../start/compatibility-matrix.md).

Follow the steps below to configure a dedicated external account to import and export Microsoft Dynamics 365 data into Adobe Campaign. 

For each system, these steps need to be performed by an administrator.

>[!CAUTION]
> Steps in this documentation will guide you through creating integrations/registrations that involve assigning permissions and/or admin access. It is your responsibility to ensure these steps comply with your company policies before performing, and to perform them carefully.

## Configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 {#config-crm-microsoft}

To connect Microsoft Dynamics 365 to work with Adobe Campaign via **Web API**, log on to [Microsoft Azure Directory](https://portal.azure.com) using a **Global administrator** credential, and follow the steps below:

1. Get your Dynamics 365 Application (client) ID. [Learn more](#get-client-id-microsoft)
1. Generate Microsoft Dynamics Certificate key identifier and Key ID. [Learn more](#config-certificate-key-id)
1. Configure permissions. [Learn more](#config-permissions-microsoft)
1. Create an App User. [Learn more](#create-app-user-microsoft)
1. Encode the private key. [Learn more](#configure-acc-for-microsoftt)


### Get Dynamics 365 Client ID {#get-client-id-microsoft}

To get the Application (client) ID, you need to register an App in Azure Active Directory. 

1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory > App Registrations**, and select **New Registration**.
1. Enter a unique name which can help identify an instance, such as **adobecampaign`<instance identifier>`**.

Once you save, Microsoft Azure Directory assigns a unique **Application (client) ID** to your app. You will need this ID later on in configuring Dynamics 365 in Adobe Campaign.

Learn more in [Microsoft Dynamics 365 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory){target="_blank"}.

### Generate Microsoft Dynamics Certificate key identifier and Key ID {#config-certificate-key-id}

To get the **Certificate key identifier (customKeyIdentifier)** and the **Key ID (keyId)**, you must upload a certificate. Certificates can be used as secrets to prove the applicationâ€™s identity when requesting a token. Also can be referred to as public keys.

Follow the steps below:

1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory > App Registrations** and select the Application which was created earlier.
1. Select on **Certificates & Secret**.
1. From the **Certificates** tab, click on **Upload certificate**
1. Upload your public certificate.
1. Browse to the **Manifest** link to get the **Certificate key identifier (customKeyIdentifier)** and the **Key ID (keyId)**.

The **Certificate key identifier (customKeyIdentifier)** and the **Key ID (keyId)** are needed in Campaign to configure your Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM external account using the Certificate **[!UICONTROL CRM O-Auth type]**.

+++ How to generate the public certificate

To generate the certificate, you can use openssl.

For example:

```
- openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout '<'private key name'>' -out '<'public certificate name'>
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can change the number of days, here `-days 365`, in the code sample for a longer certificate validity period.

You must then encode the certificate in base64. To do so, you can use the help of a Base64 encoder or use the command line `base64 -w0 private.key` for Linux.

### Configure permissions {#config-permissions-microsoft}

**Step 1**: Configure the **Required Permissions** for the app that was created.

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > App Registrations** and select the Application which was created earlier.
1. Click **Settings** on the top left.
1. On **Required Permissions**, click **Add** and **Select an API > Dynamics CRM Online**.
1. Click **Select**, enable **Access Dynamics 365 as organization users** checkbox and click **Select**.
1. Then, from your app, select the **Manifest** under the **Manage** menu.
1. From the **Manifest** editor, set the `allowPublicClient` property from `null` to `true` and click **Save**.

**Step 2**: Grant admin consent

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise applications**.
1. Select the application to which you want to grant tenant-wide admin consent.
1. From the left pane menu, select **Permissions** under **Security**.
1. Click **Grant admin consent**.

For more information on this, refer to [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent#grant-admin-consent-from-the-azure-portal).

### Create an App User {#create-app-user-microsoft}

>[!NOTE]
>
> This step is optional with **[!UICONTROL Password credentials]** authentication.

The App user is the user that the application registered above will use. Any changes made to Microsoft Dynamics using the App registered above will be done via this user.

**Step 1**: Create a non-interactive user on azure active directory

1. Click **Azure Active Directory > Users** and click **New User**.
1. Give a proper name that you want use and the username should be an email format.
1. Choose **Dynamics 365 Administrator** in the **Directory Role**.

**Step 2**:  Assign a proper license to the created user

1. From [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com), click on **Admin app**.
1. Go to **Users > Active Users** and click on the newly created user.
1. Click on **Edit product licenses** and select the **Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan**.
1. Click **Close**.

**Step 3**: Create an application user on Dynamics CRM

1. From [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to **Settings > Security > Users**.
1. Click on drop-down, select **Application users**, and click **New**.
1. Use the same username as the user created on active directory above.
1. Assign the **Application ID** for [the application you created earlier](#get-client-id-microsoft).
1. Click on **Manage Roles** and choose the **System administrator** role to the user.

## Synchronize enumerations{#sfdc-enum-sync}

Once the schema is created, you can synchronize enumerations automatically from Dynamics 365 to Adobe Campaign.

1. Open the assistant from the  **[!UICONTROL Synchronizing enumerations...]** link. 
1. Select the Adobe Campaign enumeration that matches the Dynamics 365 enumeration. 
    You can replace all values of an Adobe Campaign enumeration with those of the CRM: to do this, select **[!UICONTROL Yes]** in the **[!UICONTROL Replace]** column.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** and then **[!UICONTROL Start]** to start importing the enumerations.
1. Browse the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Platform > Enumerations]** node to check imported values.

Adobe Campaign and Microsoft Dynamics 365 are now connected. You can set up data synchronization between the two systems. 

To synchronize data between Adobe Campaign data and Microsoft CRM, create a workflow and use the **[!UICONTROL CRM connector]** activity.

Learn more about data synchronization [in this page](crm-data-sync.md).
