# Work with Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager

Integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager allows you to manage the content of your email deliveries as well as your forms directly in Adobe Experience Manager.

You can also directly insert assets from your Adobe Experience Manager Assets Library while editing an email or a landing page in Adobe Campaign. This functionality is detailed in the Adobe Experience Manager Assets [chapter](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/assets/overview.html).

This means that you can make the most of both Adobe Experience Manager content editing capabilities and Adobe Campaign delivery capabilities.
