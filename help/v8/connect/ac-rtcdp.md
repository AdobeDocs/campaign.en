# Work with Campaign and Real-Time Customer Data Platform

With **Adobe Experience Platform**, you can share data between Campaign and Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform (RTCDP). This allows you to target Adobe Experience Platform audiences in your Campaign workflows, then send back to Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform data related to these audiences like sends, opens, and clicks.
