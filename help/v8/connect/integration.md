## Integrate with your CRM Connector{#gs-crm-connectors}

You can connect your Adobe Campaign platform to your **CRM third-party systems** and synchronize data: contacts, accounts, purchases, etc. 

Activate your CRM data on cross-channel communication: learn how to pass on contacts from your CRM system to Adobe Campaign, and share campaign data back from Adobe Campaign to your CRM system.
CRM connectors enable quick and easy data integration: Adobe Campaign provides a dedicated assistant for collecting and selecting from the tables available in the CRM. This guarantees two-directional synchronization to make sure data is up-to-date at all times throughout the systems.
