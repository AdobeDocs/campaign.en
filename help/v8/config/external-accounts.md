# Configure your external accounts

Adobe Campaign comes with a set of pre-defined external accounts. In order to set up connections with external systems, you can create new external accounts.

External accounts are used by technical processes such as technical workflows or campaign workflows. For example, when setting up a file transfer in a workflow or a data exchange with any other application (Adobe Target, Experience Manager, etc.), you need to select an external account.


>[!CAUTION]

>The internal email delivery routing external account must not be enabled in Adobe Campaign.

A specific external account manages connection between Campaign local database and Cloud database ([!DNL Snowflake]).
