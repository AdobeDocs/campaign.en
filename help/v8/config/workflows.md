## Design and use workflows{#gs-ac-wf}

Use Adobe Campaign workflows to improve the speed and scale of every aspect of your marketing campaigns, from creating segments and preparing messages to delivery.

Learn how to design workflows in these [end-to-end use cases](#end-to-end-uc).

### Change Data Source Activity {#change-data-source-activity}

There are two goals here:

Provide a new workflow activity allowing to "change" the "data-source" of workflow working table (Technically it will create a new working table on the new data-source and perform a copy of the input data to this new working table)
In V8, this activity allows the possibility to perform large and efficient unitary operations on working table data by moving the worktable from snowflake to postgresql.
Simplify the understanding of the location (data-source) of the workflow working table
Display Target: Add the data Source information
Javascript Activity: Add a warning at execution when queryDef , write are used directly on the Snowflake database

 A new workflow activity is introduced. The <b>Change Data Source</b> activity allows you to change the data source of a workflow working table. This provides enhanced flexibility in managing data across different data sources (FDA, FFDA & local database)
An Adobe Campaign workflow handles data thanks to what we call a Working table (aka temporary table). As the workflow executes, working tables are sharing data across workflow activities.
By default, Working Tables are created on the same database than the source of the data we query on.
Example: With V8, main profiles table is now stored on Cloud database directly. So querying on Profiles table will create a working table on Cloud database as well.
Sometimes it could make sense to move the working table to another data source in order to perform specific operation(s)
Example :
- I query on my Products List which is stored on the Cloud Database.
- A new working table is then created on Cloud database and this contains the result of my query.
- Now I need to run a Javascript Activity that performs unitary operations on this working table.
- I know this is not recommended to perform such unitary operations on the Cloud Database directly.
- Then I will first move the working table from Cloud Database to the local Postgres Database.
- I am now able to run my script on top of the local Postgres database which is more efficient with unitary operations.
This was just an example and there are many other use use cases that benefit from this new <b>Change Data Source</b> activity.


## Set up recurring campaigns

Design recurring workflow and create a new delivery instance each time the workflow is executed. For example, if your workflow is designed to run once a week, that would result in 52 Deliveries after one year. This also means that logs will be separated by each delivery instance.

## Leverage trigger events

Use Campaign Transactional messaging to automate messages generated from events triggered from information systems. These transactional messages can be invoice, order confirmation, shipping confirmation, password change, product unavailability notification, account statement or website account creation for instance. These messages can be sent individually or in batch via email, SMS or push notifications.

üí° Learn more about transactional messaging capabilities in in [this section](../send/transactional.md).

Connect Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics to retrieve user actions and send near real-time personalized messages.
