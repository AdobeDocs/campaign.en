# Create pre-defined filters{#creating-pre-defined-filters}

 Create pre-defined filters to define eligibility rules for the target population that can easily be re-used during offer creation. They are specific to each environment and take the offer parameters into account.

To create a pre-defined filter, apply the following process:

1. Browse to the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** folder and select **[!UICONTROL Pre-defined offer filters]**.
