# Work with Campaign and Real-time Customer Data Platform

With Adobe Experience Platform, you can share data between Campaign and Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform (RTCDP). This allows you to target Adobe Experience Platform audiences in your Campaign workflows, then send back to Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform data related to these audiences like sends, opens, and clicks.

:speech_balloon: As a Managed Cloud Service user, [contact Adobe](start/support.md#support) to connect RTCDP and Campaign.
