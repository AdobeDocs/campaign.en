* Learn how to create a SMS delivery in [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-messages-on-mobiles/sms-create.html?lang=en#sending-messages)

Before starting sending SMS:

* Make sure recipient profiles contain at least a mobile phone in their profile.
* Review the Adobe Campaign Classic [Delivery best practices](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/key-steps-when-creating-a-delivery/delivery-bestpractices/delivery-best-practices.html?lang=en#sending-messages) which also apply to Campaign v8.

In addition, you need to be familiar with the SMS protocol and settings. Walk through the connection set up between Adobe Campaign and a SMPP provider in [this document](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-messages-on-mobiles/sms-protocol.html?lang=en#sending-messages)
