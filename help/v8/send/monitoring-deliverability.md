# Monitor your deliverability{#monitoring-deliverability}

Below you will find details on the different monitoring tools provided by Adobe Campaign, as well as some additional guidelines on leveraging the features offered by Adobe Campaign to monitor your platform's deliverability.

## Monitoring tools {#monitoring-tools}

Adobe Campaign gives you access to all the deliverability tools listed below.

* The [Inbox rendering report](inbox-rendering.md) enables you to preview your messages on major email clients in order to scan content and reputation.

* The **[!UICONTROL Delivery throughput]** report gives you an overview of the entire platform's throughput for a given period. For more on this, see [this section](../reporting/global-reports.md#delivery-throughput).
* Each delivery generates a broadcast statistics report for the different Internet service providers (ISPs). It shows some data quality and reputation metrics that may impact your deliverability, including the following numbers:
    * **[!UICONTROL Hard bounces]** indicate data quality. This number should be less than 2%.
    * **[!UICONTROL Soft bounces]** indicate reputation. This number should not be higher than 10% for any given ISP.
    
    <!--For more on this, see the [Delivery statistics](../reporting/global-reports.md#delivery-statistics) section.-->

* More generally, the [delivery dashboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/monitoring-deliveries/delivery-dashboard.html#sending-messages){target="_blank"} gives you access to:
    * the delivery summary, which shows the detail of the sending and the number of messages to send, processed and sent with success;
    * the delivery logs and history, which show which target has been excluded and why;
    * the tracking logs, which show tracking information such as opens and clicks.

## Monitoring guidelines {#monitoring-guidelines}

Here are some additional guidelines on deliverability monitoring:

* Regularly check the [delivery throughput](../reporting/global-reports.md#delivery-throughput) for the whole platform to verify whether it is consistent with the original set-up.
* Check that [retries](delivery-failures.md#retries) are set up correctly (30 minutes for retry period and more than 20 retries) in delivery templates.
* Regularly verify that the [bounce](delivery-failures.md#bounce-mail-qualification) mailbox is accessible and that the account is not about to expire.
* Check each delivery throughput, accessible from the [delivery dashboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/monitoring-deliveries/delivery-dashboard.html#sending-messages){target="_blank"}, to make sure that it is consistent with the delivery content's validity (e.g. 'flash sales' should be delivered in minutes, not days). is a key tool to monitor your deliveries and potential issues during the sending of messages. 
* When using [waves](configure-and-send.md#sending-using-multiple-waves), verify that each wave has enough time to finish before the next one is triggered.
* Check that the number of errors and new [quarantines](quarantines.md) are consistent with other deliveries.
* Carefully consult the [delivery logs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/monitoring-deliveries/delivery-dashboard.html#delivery-logs-and-history){target="_blank"} in detail to check the kind of errors that are highlighted (denylists, DNS issues, anti-spam rules, etc.).
