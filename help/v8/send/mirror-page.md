# About the email mirror page{#mirror-page}

The mirror page is an online version of your email.

While most email clients render images without a problem, some presets can avoid displaying images for security reasons. Users can browse to the mirror page of an email, for example if they are experiencing rendering issues or broken images when trying to view it in their inbox. It is also recommended to provide an online version for accessibility reasons, or to encourage social sharing.

The mirror page generated by Adobe Campaign contains all personalization data.

## Add a link to the mirror page{#link-to-mirror-page}

Inserting a link to the mirror page is a good practice. This link can be for example 'View this email in your browser', and is often located at the header or footer of an email. 

In Adobe Campaign, you can insert a link to the mirror page in the email content using the dedicated **personalization block**. By default, the mirror page is generated only if the link is inserted in the content of the message. 

The built-in **Link to mirror page** personalization block inserts the following code in your email content: `<%@ include view='MirrorPage' %>`.

<!--For more on personalization blocks insertion, refer to [Personalization blocks](personalization-blocks.md).-->

## Mirror page generation{#mirror-page-generation}

By default, the mirror page is automatically generated by Adobe Campaign if the email content is not empty, and if it contains a link to the mirror page (aka Mirror link).

You can control the generation mode of the email mirror page. Options are available in the delivery properties. To access these options:

1. Browse to the **[!UICONTROL Validity]** tab of the email properties.
1. In the **Mirror page management** section, check the **[!UICONTROL Mode]** drop down list.

In addition to the default mode, the following options are available:

* **[!UICONTROL Force the generation of the mirror page]**: use this mode to generate the mirror page even if no link to the mirror page is inserted in the delivery.
* **[!UICONTROL Do not generate the mirror page]**: use this mode to avoid generating a mirror page, even if the link is present in the delivery.
* **[!UICONTROL Generates a mirror page accessible using only the message identifier]**: use this option to enable access the content of the mirror page, with personalization data, in the delivery log window. To access this mirror page: once the delivery is sent, open it and browse to its **[!UICONTROL Delivery]** tab. Select a recipient and click the **[!UICONTROL Display the mirror page for this message...]** link. The mirror page displays in a new tab.
