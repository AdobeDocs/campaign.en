# Event processing {#event-processing}

In the context of transactional messaging, an event is generated by an external information system and is sent to Adobe Campaign via the **[!UICONTROL PushEvent]** and **[!UICONTROL PushEvents]** methods. These methods are described in [this section](event-description.md).
 
This event contains data linked to the event, such as:

* its [type](transactional.md#create-event-types): order confirmation, account creation on a website, etc.,
* the email address or phone number,
* any other information to enrich and personalize the transactional message before delivery: customer contact information, language of the message, email format, etc.

Example of event data:

To process transactional messaging events, the following steps are applied on the execution instance(s):

1. [Event collection](#event-collection)
1. [Event transfer to a message template](#routing-towards-a-template)
1. Event enrichment with personalization data
1. [Delivery execution](delivery-execution.md)
1. [Recycling of events](#event-recycling) whose linked delivery failed (via an Adobe Campaign workflow)

Once all the steps are achieved, each targeted recipient receives a personalized message.

## Collect events {#event-collection}

Events generated by the information system can be collected using two modes:

* Calls to SOAP methods let you push events in Adobe Campaign: the PushEvent method lets you send one event at a time, the PushEvents method lets you send several events at once. [Learn more](event-description.md).

* Creating a workflow lets you recover events by importing files or via an SQL gateway, with the [Federated Data Access](../connect/fda.md) module.

Once they are collected, events are broken down by technical workflows between real-time and batch queues of the execution instance(s), while waiting to be linked to a [message template](transactional-template.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>On the execution instances, the **[!UICONTROL Real time events]** or **[!UICONTROL Batch events]** folders must not be set as views, as this could lead to access right issues. For more on setting a folder as a view, refer to [this section](../audiences/folders-and-views.md#turn-a-folder-to-a-view).

## Transfer an event to a template {#event-to-template}

Once the message template is published on the execution instance(s), two templates are automatically generated: one to be linked to a real-time event, and one to be linked to a batch event.

The routing step consists in linking an event to the appropriate message template, based on:

* The event type specified in the properties of the event itself:

    ![](assets/event-type-sample.png)

* The event type specified in the message template properties:

    ![](assets/event-type-select.png)

By default, routing relies on the following information:

* The event type
* The channel to be used (by default: email)
* The most recent delivery template, based on the publication date

## Check event status {#event-statuses}

All processed events are grouped into a single view, in the **Event history** folder or the Explorer. They can be categorized by event type or by **status**. 

Possible statuses are:

* **Pending**

    * A pending event can be event which has just been collected and which has not yet been processed. The **[!UICONTROL Number of errors]** column shows the value 0. The email template has not yet been linked.
    * A pending event can also be an event processed but whose confirmation is erroneous. The **[!UICONTROL Number of errors]** column shows a value that is not 0. To know when this event will be processed again, consult the **[!UICONTROL Process requested on]** column.

* **Pending delivery**
     The event was processed and the delivery template is linked. The email is pending delivery and the classic delivery process is applied. For more information, you can open the delivery.
* **Sent**, **Ignored** and **Delivery error**
    These delivery statuses are recovered via the **updateEventsStatus** workflow. For more information, you can open the relevant delivery.
* **Event not covered**
    The transactional messaging routing phase failed. For example, Adobe Campaign did not find the email which acts as a template for the event.
* **Event expired**
    The maximum number of send tries was reached. The event is considered null.

## Recycle events {#event-recycling}

If the delivery of a message on a specific channel fails, Adobe Campaign can resend the message using a different channel. For instance, if a delivery on the SMS channel fails, the message is resent using the email channel.

To do this, you need to configure a workflow which recreates all events with the **Delivery error** status, and assigns a different channel to them.
