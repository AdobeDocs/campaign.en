# SMS in a mid-sourcing infrastructure {#sms-mid}

Sending SMS deliveries with a mid-sourcing infrastructure requires : 

On the **Marketing server** : 
* An external account specifying the channel and the delivery mode
* A delivery template that references the external account to streamline the sending process.

On the **Mid-server** :
* An SMS Operator used for the SMS external account created on the Marketing server
* An external account detailing the connector and message type.
