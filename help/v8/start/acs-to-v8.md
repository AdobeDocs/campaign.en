# Transition from [!DNL Campaign Standard] to [!DNL Campaign] v8 {#acs-to-acv8}

As a Campaign Standard user transitioning to Campaign v8, you can now benefit from the new version of Adobe Campaign Web User Interface and well as the powerful v8 console. The transition is seemless and will allow you to use all the intuitive features designed to simplify the creation of personalized cross-channel campaigns. Campaign Web User Interface also brings a connected canvas with Adobe Experience Platform for a unified experience.

As a Campaign v8 user, you now have access to both the new Campaign Web interface and the v8 client console. Data and settings are synchronized from an environment to another. All your data and settings available in the client console is visible in the Campaign Web user interface, from the Explorer left navigation.
