## Customize your enumerations{#customize-enumerations}

You can select values from drop-down lists in Campaign user interface. Values available in these lists are managed in enumerations.

Enumerations are managed by your Campaign Administrator via the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Platform > Enumerations]** folder of Campaign Explorer. 

For each enumeration, values are displayed in a drop-down list from which the user can select the value. 

For **Open** enumerations, the user can also enter the first characters in the value, and possible values are displayed.

Learn how to access and configure your enumerations in [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/managing-enumerations.html){target="_blank"}.


## Default units {#default-units}

In the fields that express a duration (e.g. validity period of the resources of a delivery, approval deadline for a task, etc.), the value can be expressed in the following **units**:

* **[!UICONTROL s]** for seconds,
* **[!UICONTROL mn]** for minutes,
* **[!UICONTROL h]** for hours,
* **[!UICONTROL d]** for days.
