# Early release notes {#e-new-release}

This page describes improvements and fixes included in the next Campaign v8 release. This content is subject to changes without prior notice until the release date. The official release notes are available in this [page](../start/release-notes.md).

## Release 8.6.1 {#release-8-6-1}

_Feb 14, 2024_


### New features {#new-8-6-1}

* Starting this release, you have access to the new **Campaign Web user interface**, available through the central Adobe Experience Cloud environment. Experience Cloud is Adobe's integrated family of digital marketing applications, products, and services. From its intuitive interface, you can quickly access your cloud applications, product features, and services. Learn how to connect to Adobe Experience Cloud, and access Adobe Campaign Web interface [in this page](campaign-ui.md#ac-web-ui).


* Adobe Campaign v8 now integrates with **Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service**, with authoring exclusively available via the Adobe Campaign Web User Interface.

* You can now use your **Adobe Experience Manager Assets library** alongside your Experience Cloud Assets even if the Integration with the Adobe Experience Cloud package is installed on your Adobe Campaign instance.


### General improvements {#improvements-8-6-1}

* Campaign v8.6 brings improved throughput for **email deliveries tracking indicators**. With our optimized processes, tracking ingestion and compute time is reduced, and you can check your delivery key indicators much faster.


### Deliverability updates {#deliverability-8-6-1}

* By February 2024, any company sending more than 5,000 email messages through Google or Yahoo! will have to start using an authentication technology known as Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). Make sure to have DMARC record set up for all the subdomains that you are using with Adobe Campaign.
