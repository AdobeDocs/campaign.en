# New Web user interface {#ac-web-ui}

We are thrilled to introduce the new version of Adobe Campaign Web User Interface. Our latest release is packed with intuitive features designed to simplify the creation of personalized cross-channel campaigns, drive exceptional results, and give you a competitive advantage across all channels. This new modern UI simplifies marketing campaign design and delivery, and brings consistency, along with other Adobe solutions, including Adobe Experience Platform.

As a Campaign v8 client console user, starting v8.6.1 release, you now have access to a web environment, available through the central Adobe Experience Cloud user interface. Experience Cloud is Adobe's integrated family of digital marketing applications, products, and services. From its intuitive interface, you can quickly access your cloud applications, product features, and services. Learn how to connect to Adobe Experience Cloud, and access Adobe Campaign Web interface in this page.
