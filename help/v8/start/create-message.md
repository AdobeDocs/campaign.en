# Get Started with messages{#gs-ac-audiences}

With Adobe Campaign, you can send cross-channel campaigns including emails, SMS, LINE messages, Push notifications and direct mails, and measure their effectiveness using various dedicated reports. These messages are designed and sent though deliveries, and can be personalized for each recipient.

Core functionalities include targeting, definition and personalization of messages, execution of communications, and the associated operational reports. The main functional access point is the delivery wizard. This access point leads to multiple capabilities covered by Adobe Campaign.

Adobe Campaign v8 comes with the following delivery channels:

* **Email channel**: email deliveries let you send personalized emails to the target population. Learn more in [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-emails/about-email-channel.html).

* **Direct mail channel**: direct mail deliveries let you generate an extraction file which contains data on the target population.  Learn more in [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-direct-mail/about-direct-mail-channel.html)

* **Mobile channel**: deliveries on mobile channels let you send personalized SMS to the target population.  Learn more in [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-messages-on-mobiles/sms-channel.html)
