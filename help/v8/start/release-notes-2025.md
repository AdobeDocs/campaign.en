## Release 8.6.4 {#release-8-6-4}

_Jan 15, 2025_

### General improvements {#improvements-8-6-4}

* Campaign application stability has been improved during delivery analysis in the context of an [Enterprise (FFDA) deployment](../../v8/architecture/enterprise-deployment.md).
* This release comes with improved and strengthened FFDA architecture mechanisms, including key management, staging, and data replication.
* New technical workflows have been introduced for the [Enterprise (FFDA) deployment](../../v8/architecture/enterprise-deployment.md). These workflows replicate delivery and related data by centralizing parallel replication requests on corresponding tables. These workflow start with `Replicate nms`. [Read more](../architecture/replication.md)
* A new **Enable watchdog supervisor to keep workflow running permanently** option is now available in the workflow properties. When this option is enabled, workflows automatically restart after an error occurred. The restart happens every 30 seconds by default if the workflow is still in error. To adjust this interval, you can create a new `XtkWorkflow_WatchdogTimerTimeout` option and set an Integer data type to specify the new delay. This option should only be enabled in technical workflows. [Read more](../../automation/workflow/workflow-properties.md#execution)

### Security improvements {#security-8-6-4}

Connection with Adobe solutions and apps through the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Cloud]** external account has been updated to reinforce security.
