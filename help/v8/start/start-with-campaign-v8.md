# Get started with Adobe Campaign v8 {#gs-with-v8}

With Adobe Campaign, you can use rich customer data to create, coordinate, and deliver dynamic campaigns that customers actually want — through email, mobile, offline channels, and more.

### Manage your campaigns{#manage-campaigns}

Use Adobe Campaign to communicate with your customers through multiple marketing channels. When they’re synchronized, they combine to give your customers a powerful and complementary experience with your brand.

Design, execute, and personalize your marketing across channels, while improving customer experiences on every device and touchpoint. With Adobe Campaign, you can manage multiple data sources, define your audience segments, and plan and execute multi-step, cross-channel campaigns through a drag-and-drop visual workflow interface.

* Planning

    Plan your campaigns across an extended timeline and effectively manage activities, budgets, schedules, and results in a single, integrated marketing platform.

* Automation

    Automate your campaigns based on customer engagement. Automatically trigger personalized messages in real-time depending on how each customer interacts with your brand.

* Measurement 

    Measure campaign results to get a complete picture of what works, what doesn’t, and what you can do better. Then gather and report on your data so you can analyze it more effectively.

* Rules 
    
    Limit the number of touches by customer or by channel, reducing the potential for fatigue. You also can set rules to adapt contact frequency on-the-fly, based on individual changes in engagement.  

###  Reporting and analysis tools {#reporting-tools}

In addition to powerful, out-of-the box reporting templates, Adobe Campaign lets you create custom reports on a delivery, campaign, user, or segment level. Do descriptive analysis, summarize ROI and CLTV, or export data to Adobe Analytics and other solutions for further data visualization and analysis.


The campaign reporting feature facilitates the creation of dynamic reports. You can use drag-and-drop variables to customize your reports and to analyze the success of your campaigns. Depending on the complexity of your queries and calculations, the data can be aggregated into a list view or accessed in a format that makes it easy to generate marketing analytics reports.


Visual reporting interface
Use the dynamic report interface to simplify the process of navigating through tabs, menu options, and make it easier to sort by segments, devices, and channels.

Custom reports
Customize dynamic reports by adding filters or visualizations to better view and access your analytics data.

Report sharing
Create a standard reporting view for your campaigns and automatically share it with colleagues on an automated or recurring basis.

Customizable templates
Use the out of the box report templates to build a new report from scratch, and customize the templates as needed.
