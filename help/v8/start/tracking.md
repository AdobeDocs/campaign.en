# Track and monitor messages{#gs-ac-reports}

## Tracking capabilities in Campaign

Use Campaign tracking capabilities track the messages sent and check the behavior of recipients: opening, clicks on links, subscriptions/unsubscription, and more.

This information is retrieved in the Tracking tab of the profile of each recipient of the delivery. This tab groups all the URL links tracked and clicked by a recipient selected from the list, and displays all URLs tracked in the deliveries that are available in the delivery screen. The list can be configured and typically will contain: the URL clicked, the date and time of the click, and the document in which the URL was found.

The delivery dashboard is also key to monitor your deliveries and eventual issues encountered during the sending of messages.
