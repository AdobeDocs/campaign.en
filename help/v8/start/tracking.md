## Tracking capabilities in Campaign

Campaign tracking capabilities track the messages sent and  help you analyze the behavior of recipients: opening, clicks on links, subscriptions/unsubscription, and more. You can access dedicated logs, reports and metrics, query the database to review collected data, and more.  

For more on this, refer to [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/profile-management/editing-a-profile.html?lang=en#tracking-tab){target="_blank"}.

The delivery dashboard is a key tool to monitor your deliveries and potential issues during the sending of messages. 

For more on this refer to [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/monitoring-deliveries/delivery-dashboard.html?lang=en#sending-messages){target="_blank"}.

## Monitoring guidelines

Adobe Campaign offers a set of capabilities to monitor your processes and your environment.

### Monitor your deliveries

Monitoring your deliveries after they have been sent is a key step to ensure your maketing campaigns are efficient and reach out to your customers.

Learn more about the information you can monitor after sending a delivery, understand how delivery failures and quarantines are managed in [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/monitoring-deliveries/about-delivery-monitoring.html?lang=en#sending-messages){target="_blank"}

### Monitor your workflows

Learn how to monitor workflow execution in [this page](https://experienceleague-review.corp.adobe.com/docs/campaign/automation/workflows/monitoring-workflows/monitor-workflow-execution.html)

### Monitor your instance

Instance monitoring guidelines are available in [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/monitoring-campaign-classic/introduction/monitoring-guidelines.html?lang=en#monitoring-campaign-classic){target="_blank"}

Use the Audit trail self-service interface to monitor changes made within your instance. Audit trail captures, in real-time, a comprehensive list of actions and events occurring within your Adobe Campaign instance. You can access a history of data to help answer questions such as: what happened to your workflows, and who last updated them or what did your users do in the instance.
