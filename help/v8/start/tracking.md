# Track and monitor messages{#gs-ac-reports}

## Tracking capabilities in Campaign

Campaign tracking capabilities track the messages sent and  help you analyze the behavior of recipients: opening, clicks on links, subscriptions/unsubscription, and more. You can access dedicated logs, reports and metrics, query the database to review collected data, and more.

The delivery dashboard is a key tool to monitor your deliveries and potential issues during the sending of messages.

## Monitoring guidelines

Adobe Campaign offers a set of capabilities to monitor your processes and your environment.
