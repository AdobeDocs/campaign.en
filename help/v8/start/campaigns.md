# Get Started with marketing campaigns{#gs-ac-campaigns}

Adobe Campaign offers a set of solutions that help you personalize and deliver campaigns across all of your online and offline channels. You can create, configure, execute and analyze marketing campaigns. All marketing campaigns can be managed from a unified control center. Discover how to browse and create marketing campaigns in this section.

Campaigns include actions (deliveries) and processes (importing or extracting files), as well as resources (marketing documents, delivery outlines). They are used in marketing campaigns. Campaigns are part of a program, and programs are included in a campaign plan.

## Cross-channel campaign orchestration{#cross-channel-orchestration}

Adobe Campaign lets you design and orchestrate targeted and personalized campaigns on multiple channels: email, direct mail, SMS, push notification. A single interface provides you with all the functions required to schedule, orchestrate, configure, personalize, automate, execute, and measure all your campaigns and communications.

### Core concepts{#ac-core-concepts}

Before starting implementing marketing campaigns, you need to be familiar with the following concepts:

* **Marketing campaign**: a campaign centralizes all the elements related to a marketing campaign: deliveries, targeting rules, costs, export files, related documents, etc. Each campaign is attached to a program.

* **Program**: a program lets you define marketing actions for a calendar period: launch, canvassing, loyalty, etc. Each program contains campaigns linked to a calendar, which provides an overall view.

* **Plan**: the marketing plan can contain multiple programs. It is linked to a calendar period, has an allocated budget and can also be linked up to documents and objectives.

* **Campaign workflow**: a campaign workflow contains activities to build the campaign logic. Use campaign workflows to define audiences and create deliveries for all available channels.

* **Recurring campaigns**: recurring campaigns are created from a specific template defining the workflow template to be executed and the execution schedule.

* **Periodic campaigns**: a periodic campaign is a campaign created automatically according to the execution schedule of its template.

## Key steps to start{#gs-ac-start}

Key steps to create a cross-channel marketing campaign are:

1. **Plan and design marketing programs and campaigns**

    Define hierarchy and schedule, set budget, add resources, select operators.

    All marketing campaigns are based on a template, which stores main settings and capabilities. A built-in template is supplied in order to create a campaign for which no specific configuration has been defined. You can create and configure your campaign templates and then create campaigns from these templates.
