# Manage subscriptions and unsubscriptions{#optin-optout}

Use Adobe Campaign to create and monitor your information services such as newsletters and to manage the subscriptions/unsubscriptions to these services. Several services can be defined in parallel, for example: specialist newsletters for certain product categories, themes or areas of a web site, subscriptions to various types of alert messages and real-time notifications. Refer to Manage subscriptions.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Subscriptions and unsubscriptions are **asynchronous** processes. Opt-in and opt-out requests are processed each hour.

You can also enable your delivery recipients to forward messages to a friend. To do this, insert the relevant links into your delivery. You may then track this sharing process as well as the number of visits to the concerned pages.
