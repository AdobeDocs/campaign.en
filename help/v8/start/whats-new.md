## Scale

Campaign v8 brings end-to-end scale at any step of the process, from targeting to the final reporting:

* Scale the volume of data you can handle (until 8 TB)
* Scale the performance of queries for segmentation and targeting but also data ingestion and egress
* Scale the delivery preparation (from hours to minutes)

## Simplification and performance increase

Campaign v8 brings the concept of **Full Federated Data Access** (FFDA): all data is now remote on the Cloud Database.

With this new architecture, Campaign v8 simplifies data management: no index is required on the Cloud Database. You just need to create the tables, copy the data and you can start.

[!DNL Snowflake] is the Campaign Cloud Database, it will bring you speed and endurance: no overload of the system activity peaks. 

The Cloud database technology does not require specific maintenance to guarantee the level of performance.

## Integrated ecosystem

You can also configure predictive send time optimization and predictive engagement scoring with Journey AI, and increase open rates, clicks and revenues.
