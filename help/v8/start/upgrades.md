# Versions and upgrades {#upgrades}

## Campaign versions {#versions}

Adobe Campaign periodically releases product versions which improve the performance, security, logic, and usability of your Campaign infrastructure. 

These upgrades can be:

* **Major upgrades**, from a major version to another, for example from v7 to v8. These upgrades bring new capabilities, improvements, compatibility and security updates, and fixes.
* **Minor upgrades**, from a minor version to another, for example from v8.5 to v8.6. These upgrades bring improvements, compatibility and security updates, and fixes.
* **Patch upgrades**, from a patch version to another, for example from v8.5.1 to v8.5.2. These upgrades bring security updates and fixes.

Detailed information about each new version is available in the [Release notes](release-notes.md).

To ensure a stable configuration, Adobe recommends that you install **the exact same version** on all your Campaign servers. In addition, except mentioned otherwise in the [Release notes](release-notes.md), the client console must be on **the exact same version** as the server instance. Learn how to upgrade your client console [in this page](../start/connect.md#upgrade-ac-console). 

As a Campaign Managed Services customer, when a new Campaign version is available, your infrastructure is upgraded by Adobe without any further action.

Note that, as a customer, you must ensure that you are using the latest supported versions of the systems listed in the [Compatibility matrix](compatibility-matrix.md).

### Why does my organization need this upgrade? {#upgrades-1}

Upgrading your infrastructure to the latest version ensures that your account is secure from vulnerabilities, as well as using updated performance technology. 

Typically, upgrading to the latest version brings:

* Improved security

    Security needs constant focus and proactive maintenance. Security risks are omnipresent & cannot be ignored: every upgrade for Campaign improves security. These upgrades must be applied to all your Campaign instances, and also to the client console. A combination of technologies are used to power Adobe Campaign work together to deliver value. All these technologies must be kept up-to-date?

* Improved support

    Most of the critical issues are actually resolved with upgrades and can be avoided. Regular upgrades help reduce faced challenges and increase efficiency by eliminating these challenges. Customer Care volume is reduced, allowing for speedier resolutions and more attention to your issues that are not related to upgrades.


* Improved maintenance and stability

    Over time, the Adobe Campaign team identifies ways to improve the stability and performance of the product, as well as fix known issues. Upgrading brings your instance up-to-date with these improvements and eliminates common challenges seen by organizations that are experiencing rapid growth and/or complexity within their Campaign instances.Improvements across the technology stack powering Campaign are felt across both marketing and IT teams of your organization.
