Adobe Campaign is regularly updated. This regular frequency of updates aims at getting the latest and greatest in your hands, keeping your environment secure and improving your experience with our product. Adobe strongly recommends all customers to upgrade to the latest version.

As a Managed Cloud Services user, your instance is upgraded by Adobe with every new release. Adobe will contact you and upgrade your environments. Campaign Client Console **must be upgraded to the same version** as Campaign servers. Learn how to upgrade your Client Console in this [page](../start/connect.md#upgrade-ac-console). 

In addition, as a customer, ensure that you are using the latest supported versions of the systems listed in the [Compatibility matrix](compatibility-matrix.md).
