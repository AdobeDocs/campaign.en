# Get Started with Campaign APIs{#gs-ac-api}

Adobe Campaign uses two types of APIs:

* Generic data acces APIs for querying the datamodel data. Refer to [Data oriented APIs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/configuring-campaign-classic/api/data-oriented-apis.html).
* Business specific APIs that let you act on each object: deliveries, workflows, subscriptions, etc. [Refer to Business oriented APIs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/configuring-campaign-classic/api/business-oriented-apis.html).

In order to develop APIs and interact with Adobe Campaign, you need to be familiar with your datamodel. Adobe Campaign lets you generate a complete description of the base. Refer to [this page](datamodel.md).
