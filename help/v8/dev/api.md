# Get Started with Campaign APIs{#gs-ac-api}

Adobe Campaign comes with a set of Javascript functions which you can use:

* in Scripts - in Adobe Campaign workflows
* via APIs - from external systems

[All Javascript functions are listed in this documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/technicalresources/api/p-1.html)

You can use Javascript APIs to write in Campaign cloud database or read from the database:

* Business specific APIs that let you act on each object: deliveries, workflows, subscriptions, etc. [Refer to Business oriented APIs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/configuring-campaign-classic/api/business-oriented-apis.html).
* Generic data acces APIs for querying the datamodel data. Refer to [Data oriented APIs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/configuring-campaign-classic/api/data-oriented-apis.html).


## Prerequisites

Before using the Adobe Campaign APIs, you need to be familliar with the following topics:

* Javascript
* SOAP protocol
* Adobe Campaign datamodel

In order to use APIs and interact with Adobe Campaign, you also need to be familiar with your datamodel.  

**Note** - You can generate a complete description of your datamodel. Learn more in [this page](datamodel.md).
