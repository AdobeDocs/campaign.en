## Create new data fields and schemas

Adobe Campaign makes use of Data Schemas to:

* Define how data objects within the application are tied to underlying database tables
* Define links between the different data objects within the Campaign application
* Define and describe the individual fields included in each object

For example, to add a field to an existing table, such as the recipient table (nms:recipient), you have to extend that schema. 

Two table extension modes are available:

* Through the interface, by using the **New field** assistant

* Programmatically, by extending the schema

    üí° Learn how to extend an existing schema in [this section](../dev/extend-schema.md).


You can also create new tables in the Campaign database and extend the built-in datamodel.

To add an entirely new type of data that does not exist out-of-the-box in Adobe Campaign (a table of contracts for example) you can create a custom schema directly. For more on this, refer to [this example](../dev/create-schema.md#example--creating-a-contract-table).

## Modify the input forms

Campaign input forms can be adapted to adapt to your implementation. You can add or remove form fields by modifying the XML content.

## Customize dashboards{#gs-custom-dashboards}

The Adobe Campaign interface uses many Web applications to access, manage, and interact with recipients, deliveries, campaigns, stocks, etc. They are seen in the interface in the form of dashboards with only one page.

The out-of-the-box Web applications are stored in the Administration > Configuration > Web applications node.

## Customize lists and create filters {#gs-lists-and-filters}

### Access data from dashboards

Campaign lists come with predefined filters to facilitate navigation and data vizualisation. 

‚ÜóÔ∏è Learn more about filtering options in [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/filtering-data/filtering-options.html?lang=en#about-filtering)


### Access data from the Explorer

When you navigate in the Adobe Campaign Explorer tree, the data contained in the database is displayed in lists. You can filter these lists, run searches, add information, filter and sort data.

‚ÜóÔ∏è Learn how to configure lists and save a list configuration in [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/starting-with-adobe-campaign/campaign-workspace/adobe-campaign-ui-lists.html?lang=en#getting-started)


You can apply filter on these lists to display only the data needed by the operator. Then actions can then be executed on the filtered data. Filter configuration lets you select data from a list dynamically. If the data is modified, the filtered data is updated.
