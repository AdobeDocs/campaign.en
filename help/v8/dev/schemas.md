# Get Started with schemas{#gs-ac-schemas}

The physical and logical structure of the data carried in the application is described in XML. It obeys a grammar specific to Adobe Campaign, called a schema.

A schema is an XML document associated with a database table. It defines data structure and describes the SQL definition of the table:

* The name of the table
* Fields
* Indexes
* Links with other tables

Learn more about schema elements and attributes and how to extend your datamodel in [Campaign Classic documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/configuring-campaign-classic/schema-reference/about-schema-reference.html?lang=en#syntax-of-schemas)
