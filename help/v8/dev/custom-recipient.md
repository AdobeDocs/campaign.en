# Use a custom recipient table{#gs-ac-custom-recipient}

Adobe Campaign comes with a built-in profile table: **nmsRecipient**. This table has a number of pre-defined fields and tables that can be easily extended. Learn more about this table in [this page](datamodel.md#ootb-profiles).

Built-in table extension offers flexibility, but it does not allow to remove some unused fields or links. As a consequence, using a custom recipient table can be a good option when your data model differs drastically from Campaign built-in recipient table structure, or if you have a large number of profiles.  However, this method requires certain precautions when implementing it.

Learn how to configure your instance to use a custom recipient table in [Campaign Classic v7 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/configuring-campaign-classic/use-a-custom-recipient-table/about-custom-recipient-table.html){target="_blank"}.
