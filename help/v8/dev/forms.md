# Get Started with input forms{#gs-ac-forms}

When you create or extend a schema, you need to create or modify the associated input forms to make those changes visible to end-users.

An input form lets you edit an instance associated with a data schema from the Adobe Campaign client console. The form is identified by its name and namespace.

The identification key of a form is a string made up of the namespace and the name separated by a colon (‘:’) (for example: “cus:contact”).

## Edit input forms

Create and configure input forms from the **[!UICONTROL Administration] > [!UICONTROL Configuration] > [!UICONTROL Input forms]** folder of the client console:

The editing zone lets you enter the XML content of the input form:

The preview generates a display of the input form:
