# Get Started with reporting{#gs-ac-reports}

Adobe Campaign provides a set of reporting tools listed in this page.

* **Cubes**

    Adobe Campaign comes with an intuitive data exploration tool to create dynamic reports.
        
    Use marketing analytics capatilities to analyze and measure data, calculate statistics, simplify and optimize report creation and calculation. You can create reports and build target populations and store them into lists which can be used in Adobe Campaign for targeting or segmentation tasks.

    Depending on the complexity of the queries, calculations and volumes, the data analyzed in these reports can be collected via a query and pre-aggregated in a list (data management type workflow) or in a Cube (using Marketing Analytics). It will be displayed in the form of a pivot table or a group list.

    For more on this, refer to [this section](gs-cubes.md).

* **Built-in reports**

    Adobe Campaign comes with reports on deliveries, campaigns, platform activities, optional capabilities, etc. These reports are available via the various functionalities which they relate to. They can be adapted to suit your specific needs.
