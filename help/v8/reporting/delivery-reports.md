## Tracking indicators {#tracking-indicators}

This report combines the key indicators for tracking the behavior of recipients upon receiving the delivery. It gives access to delivery and reception statistics, open and click-through rates, generated click streams, web tracking as well as sharing activities to social networks.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Values calculated based on message opens are always estimates, due to the margin of error linked to emails in text format. The **[!UICONTROL Distinct opens/Sum of opens for the population reached]** indicators take this margin of error into account. [Learn more](metrics-calculation.md#tracking-opens-).

![](assets/tracking-report-synthesis.png)

**[!UICONTROL 1. Delivery statistics]**

* **[!UICONTROL Messages to deliver]** : Total number of messages to be delivered after delivery analysis.
* **[!UICONTROL Success]** : Number of messages successfully processed.

**[!UICONTROL 2. Reception statistics]**

>[!NOTE]
>
>The related percentages are calculated based on the number of messages forwarded successfully.

* **[!UICONTROL Distinct opens for the population reached]** : Estimation of the number of targeted recipients having opened a message at least once. Clicks on tracked URLs are taken into account since emails have to be opened to click on a link.
* **[!UICONTROL Sum of opens for the population reached]** : Estimation of the total number of opens by targeted recipients. 
* **[!UICONTROL Clicks on opt-out link]** : Number of clicks on the unsubscription link.
* **[!UICONTROL Clicks on the mirror page link]** : Number of clicks on the link to the mirror page. In order to be taken into account, the link must be defined as such in the delivery wizard (tracked URLs). <!--Refer to this [page](../../delivery/using/about-delivery-monitoring.md).--> 
* **[!UICONTROL Estimation of forwards]** : Estimation of the number of emails forwarded by the targeted recipients. This value is calculated by subtracting the number of distinct people and the number of distinct recipients who clicked in the email.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >For more information on the difference between distinct people and targeted recipients, refer to [Targeted persons / recipients](metrics-calculation.md#targeted-persons---recipients).

**[!UICONTROL 3. Open and click-through rate]**

This table of values shows the breakdown of deliveries, opens, clicks and raw reactivity per Internet domain. The following indicators are used:

* **[!UICONTROL Sent]** : Total number of messages sent on this domain. 
* **[!UICONTROL Complaints]** : Number of messages for this domain that have been reported as undesirable by the recipient. The rate is calculated based on the total number of messages sent on this domain.
* **[!UICONTROL Opens]** : Number of distinct targeted recipients for this domain who have opened a message at least once. The rate is calculated based on the total number of messages sent on this domain.
* **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** : Number of distinct targeted recipients who clicked in the same delivery at least once. The rate is calculated based on the total number of messages sent on this domain 
* **[!UICONTROL Raw reactivity]** : Percentage of the number of recipient who clicked in a delivery at least once compared to the number of recipients who opened a delivery at least once.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The domain names displayed in this report are defined in the itemized list used at cube level. To change, add or remove default domains, edit the **[!UICONTROL Domains]** itemized list and modify values and aliases. The **[!UICONTROL Others]** category includes domain names that don't belong to any value of the itemized list.

* **[!UICONTROL Cumulated clicks]** : Total number of clicks by targeted recipients, excluding unsubscription links and mirror pages.
* **[!UICONTROL Recipient clicks]** : Number of distinct targeted recipients who clicked in the same delivery at least once.
* **[!UICONTROL Estimated recipient reactivity]** : Ratio of the number of recipients having clicked at least once in a delivery compared to the estimated number of recipients having opened a delivery at least once. Clicks on the opt-out and mirror page links are not taken into account.
<!--
**[!UICONTROL 5. Web tracking]**

* **[!UICONTROL Visited pages]** : Number of web pages visited following message reception.

This report shows the list of pages visited following a delivery. 

![](assets/s_ncs_user_url_report.png)

You can configure the contents of this report by selecting: the score chart to be displayed, the time filter (since the action launch, over the first 6 hours following launch, etc.) and the data display mode (by label, by URL, by category. Click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** to confirm your selection.

The following rates are displayed in the upper section of the report:

* **[!UICONTROL Reactivity]** : Ratio of the number of targeted recipients having clicked in a delivery, in relation to the estimated number of targeted recipients having opened a delivery. Clicks on the opt-out link and on the mirror page are not taken into account.

It lets you track the marketing impact of the delivery. You can configure how values are displayed by changing the timescale (1-hour, 3-hour, or 24-hour view, etc.). Click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** to confirm your selection.

This report provides a table of values and a Pareto chart which display the time required for the delivery to reach maximum efficiency. The following indicators are used:

## Cumulative reports {#cumulated-reports}

You can display cumulated reports on deliveries. To do this, select the deliveries to be compared to obtain the list of reports for these deliveries.
