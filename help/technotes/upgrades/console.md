# End of support on 32-bit operating systems {#console-eol}

The 32-bit version of the client console is deprecated in 8.5 release. A new 64-bit version of the client console is available for a seamless upgrade.

Starting 8.6 release, Campaign stops supporting 32-bit operating systems, including product and security updates. Adobe strongly recommends that you keep your security updates current.

You are only impacted by this change if you have the 32-bit version of Windows 8 or 10.

## End of support{#eol}

End of support means that Adobe no longer provides technical support, including product and/or security updates, for all derivatives of a product or product version (localized versions, minor upgrades, operating systems, dot and double-dot releases, and connector products).

## Recommendations{#console-eol-recommendations}

To take advantage of the latest features and improved security, you must upgrade your computer to a 64-bit OS.
