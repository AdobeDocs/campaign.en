# Campaign sending infrastructure migration to Amazon Web Services (AWS) {#migrate-infra-to-aws}

## What changed?{#aws-changes}

As part of our ongoing effort to provide the highest quality email delivery service, the Campaign email sending infrastructure is being moved from Adobe hosted datacenters to Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

This move will ensure high availability, optimal throughput, and the ability to scale to meet our customers' needs.  

## Are you impacted?{#aws-impact}

As a v8 customer, or a v7 hosted, hybrid, or Managed Services Campaign customer, you are impacted.

## When will this migration happen?{#aws-timeline}

The development and staging environments migration will take place in **October 2023**. 

The production environments migration is scheduled to begin in **January 2024**. More details will be provided as the date approaches. 

As a Campaign customer, you will receive additional notification as the migration waves are scheduled. Notifications will be sent at least seven days in advance of the migration.

## What is the impact?{#impact}

This move will be transparent to customers: 

* Sending IPs and Campaign build version will remain the same as they were prior to the move. 

* During the migration window Campaign instances will be unable to send mail. No other Campaign function will be affected. 

* Any mail queued for delivery before the maintenance window must be resent.
